This model was inspired by the VGG16 model that won IMAGENET competiotion. The current model has been trained on my CPU and gives 91% training and 87% validation accuracy.

Future work includes cleaning up the output and having a visual of testing accuracy. The finished product will be trained on a cloud GPU. Long term future goals include making the model work on small scale hardware.
